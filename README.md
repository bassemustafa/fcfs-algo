#  First Come First Served Scheduling Algorithm.

## OS college project for scheduling algorithms to handle CPU Processes in the queue using FCFS Algorithm.

### The Project Walkthrough:

- Read processes information from CSV file:
  - ID.
  - Arrival Time.
  - Burst TIme [Excution Time].
- Print the queue.
- Calculate Total Waitin Time.
- Calculate Average Waiting Time.


**Give it try:**
-   Clone the repo.
-   Open your **Terminal** and go to the repo directroy.
-   `python .`
-   Have Fun!

**Feel free to copy, snip, clone, and/or fork the project**
